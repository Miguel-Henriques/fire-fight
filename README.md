# Fire Fight

![fire-fight-game](/docs/Firefight.png)
  
Fire fight is a turn-based fire fighting simulation 2D game built on Java.  
It was built to showcase Java's Object Oriented Programming core concepts in the scope of an OOP subject as part of my computer science degree.
It is built as a multi-project mono repo composed of two elements: **core**, which contains the core game logic and data structures and the **graph pack**, containing the graphical interface for the game.

## Opportunties for improvement

SOLID principles are poorly applied.
instanceof is overly abused and violates the proper usage of polymorphism
Folder structure is overly complicated.
