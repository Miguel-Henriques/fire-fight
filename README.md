A turn-based fire fighting simulation game built on Java.  
This project is a simple showcase of Java's Object Oriented Programming core concepts in action.  
It is built as a multi-project mono repo composed of two elements: **core**, which contains the core game logic and data structures and the **graph pack**, containing the graphical interface for the game.
